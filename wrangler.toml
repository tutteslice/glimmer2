# IMPORTANT: For security, do not hardcode your API key here.
# Instead, use Cloudflare Workers Secrets or Environment Variables
# configured in your Cloudflare dashboard for the 'glimmer' Worker.
# The value "YOUR_CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SECRET_BINDING_NAME" should
# be replaced with the name of the secret binding in your Worker's settings.
# For example, if you add a secret called 'GEMINI_API_KEY' in the dashboard,
# then here you would write: VITE_API_KEY = "GEMINI_API_KEY"
